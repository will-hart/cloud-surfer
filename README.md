# Hyper Farmer

This is an endless runner style game made for GMTK 2021 Game Jam using [Bevy
engine][bevy].

The theme was "joined together" and for some unknown reason you've decided to
manage your farm using tractors with laser beams.

# Known issues

- Audio in web-builds might sound bad in some browsers. See
  [bevy_kira_audio/#9][firefox-sound-issue] for more information.
- The game over sound doesn't play.
